# Completed Tasks for CraftGraph

## Completed Steps

1. **Ensure the `networkx` library is installed**:
   - Verified that the `networkx` library is available for use in the project.

2. **Create the Knowledge Graph Parser**:
   - Developed a parser to read and interpret the knowledge graph using `networkx`.
   - Implemented functionality to extract information about resources and crafting recipes.

3. **Define the Knowledge Graph Structure**:
   - Used `networkx` to create a basic structure for the knowledge graph.
   - Represented resources and crafting recipes as nodes and edges.

4. **Implement a Basic Parser**:
   - Developed a parser to read and interpret the knowledge graph.
   - Ensured it can extract information about resources and crafting recipes.

5. **Test the Knowledge Graph**:
   - Verified the setup by allowing players to view available resources.
   - Implemented a simple test for selecting a resource and viewing its details.

6. **Implement Resource Manager**:
   - Created a ResourceManager class to handle resource-related operations.
   - Implemented methods for generating resource nodes, gathering resources, and replenishing resources.

7. **Develop Game Interface**:
   - Created a GameInterface class to manage player interactions with the game.
   - Implemented methods for displaying available resources, gathering resources, and showing inventory.

8. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Developed comprehensive unit tests for the Knowledge Graph Parser, Resource Manager, and Game Interface.
   - Ensured test coverage for key functionalities including initialization, resource generation, gathering, and replenishment.

9. **Implement Resource Gathering**:
   - Added functionality for players to gather resources from available resource nodes.
   - Integrated resource gathering with the inventory system.

10. **Create Basic User Interface**:
