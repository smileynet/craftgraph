# CraftGraph Game Overview

## Introduction
CraftGraph is a simple game focused on crafting and resource gathering. The game logic is defined using knowledge graphs, while the rest of the game is implemented in Python.

## Game Mechanics
- **Resource Gathering**: Players collect various resources from the environment.
- **Crafting**: Players use gathered resources to craft items and tools.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: The game logic, including crafting recipes and resource dependencies, is defined using knowledge graphs.

## Objectives
- Create an engaging and educational experience for players.
- Demonstrate the use of knowledge graphs in game development.

## Features
1. **Resource Nodes**: Different types of resources available for collection.
2. **Crafting System**: A system to combine resources into new items.
3. **Inventory Management**: Players can manage their collected resources and crafted items.
4. **Progression**: Unlock new crafting recipes and resources as the game progresses.
