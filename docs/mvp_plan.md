# CraftGraph MVP Plan

## Introduction
This document outlines the incremental steps and major milestones for developing the CraftGraph game. The focus is on implementing features in small, meaningful increments and utilizing knowledge graphs as a central fixture of the project.

## Incremental Steps with Outcomes and Tests

### Step 1: Basic Knowledge Graph Setup
- **Objective**: Establish the foundation for using knowledge graphs in the game.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define a simple knowledge graph structure for resources and crafting recipes.
  - Implement a basic parser to read and interpret the knowledge graph.
- **Outcome**: A knowledge graph is created with initial resource nodes.
- **Test**: Verify that the player can view the available resources in the knowledge graph.

### Step 2: Resource Gathering
- **Objective**: Allow players to gather resources from the environment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement resource nodes based on the knowledge graph.
  - Develop a simple interface for players to collect resources.
- **Outcome**: Players can gather resources from defined nodes.
- **Test**: Allow the player to see available resources and select a resource to gather it, ensuring the resource is added to their inventory.

### Step 3: Crafting System
- **Objective**: Enable players to craft items using gathered resources.
- **Tasks**:
  - Use the knowledge graph to define crafting recipes.
  - Implement a crafting interface for players to combine resources.
- **Outcome**: Players can craft items using gathered resources.
- **Test**: Allow the player to select resources and craft an item, verifying the item appears in their inventory.

### Step 4: Inventory Management
- **Objective**: Provide players with a way to manage their resources and crafted items.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop an inventory system to store resources and items.
  - Integrate the inventory with the crafting system.
- **Outcome**: Players can view and manage their inventory.
- **Test**: Allow the player to open their inventory, view items, and organize them.

### Step 5: User Interface
- **Objective**: Create a basic user interface for player interaction.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design and implement a simple web-based UI for resource gathering and crafting.
  - Ensure the UI is intuitive and easy to use.
  - Implement a simple chat interface for player interaction. Players can type commands to interact with the game.
- **Outcome**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the game.
- **Test**: Allow the player to navigate the UI, gather resources, and craft items seamlessly.

## Major Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Prototype
- Completion of Steps 1 and 2.
- Basic resource gathering functionality with knowledge graph integration.

### Milestone 2: Crafting and Inventory
- Completion of Steps 3 and 4.
- Fully functional crafting system and inventory management.

### Milestone 3: User Interface
- Completion of Step 5.
- A basic, user-friendly interface for interacting with the game.

## Conclusion
By following this plan, we aim to develop CraftGraph in a structured and efficient manner, ensuring that knowledge graphs are a central component of the game from the outset. Each step will be play-tested to ensure quality and engagement.
